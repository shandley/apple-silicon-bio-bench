# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation from the ASBB project development.

## Why These Files Are Archived

**These documents represent the evolution of the project** from initial systematic experimentation (October-November 2025) to the current four-pillar democratization mission.

While they're no longer active guidance, they provide valuable context for understanding:
- How the project methodology evolved
- Key decisions made during development
- Lessons learned from exploratory work
- Session-by-session progress during experimentation phase

---

## Archive Structure

### `session-summaries/`

**Daily summaries and checkpoints** from the intensive experimentation phase (October 30 - November 2, 2025):

- Session summaries capturing daily progress
- Pilot readiness assessments (AMX, Parallel)
- Phase 1 day-by-day summaries
- Restart instructions from Level 1/2 attempt (later abandoned)

**Historical value**: Shows the systematic pilot-by-pilot approach that generated 849 experiments

---

### `explorations/`

**Exploratory thinking and strategic documents** that informed current direction:

- **AMX_NEURAL_CREATIVE_EXPLORATION.md**: Creative exploration of AMX/Neural Engine (deferred after negative AMX findings)
- **REALISTIC_VALUE_ASSESSMENT.md**: Value framing (superseded by DEMOCRATIZING_BIOINFORMATICS_COMPUTE.md)
- **PUBLICATION_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md**: Early publication thinking (superseded)
- **PROJECT_ROADMAP.md**: Early roadmap (superseded by four-pillar mission)
- **Various documentation audits**: Meta-reviews of project status

**Historical value**: Shows strategic thinking that led to current four-pillar mission

## What Superseded These Documents

**Current active documentation** (see root directory):

1. **DEMOCRATIZING_BIOINFORMATICS_COMPUTE.md** - The mission statement
   - Supersedes: REALISTIC_VALUE_ASSESSMENT.md, PROJECT_ROADMAP.md

2. **CLAUDE.md** - Development guide with four-pillar framework
   - Supersedes: Session summaries, outdated sections

3. **CURRENT_STATUS.md** - Always-current status
   - Supersedes: All session summaries and checkpoints

4. **results/PHASE1_COMPLETE_ANALYSIS.md** - Comprehensive Phase 1 analysis
   - Supersedes: PHASE1_COMPLETENESS_REVIEW.md, PUBLICATION_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md

5. **OPTIMIZATION_RULES.md** - Developer quick reference
   - Remains current, no superseded docs

## When to Reference Archived Docs

**Useful for**:
- Understanding historical context of decisions
- Reviewing lessons learned from abandoned approaches (Level 1/2)
- Tracing evolution of project scope
- Academic paper "Methods" section (describe systematic approach)

**Not useful for**:
- Current development guidance (see CLAUDE.md)
- Current status (see CURRENT_STATUS.md)
- Current roadmap (see DEMOCRATIZING_BIOINFORMATICS_COMPUTE.md)
