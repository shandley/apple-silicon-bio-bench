# Next Steps for ASBB Development

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Status**: Phase 1 Day 1 Complete - Multi-scale pilot experiments successful, critical optimization bug discovered and fixed

---

## 🚨 Critical Development Philosophy 🚨

### Think Apple Silicon First, Not x86 First

**Key lesson from BioMetal**: We repeatedly fell back into traditional x86-era optimization patterns. This was limiting.

**For ASBB implementation**:
- ✓ **Learn from** bioinformatics literature (algorithms, domain knowledge)
- ✗ **Don't blindly copy** optimization strategies from x86 tools
- ✓ **Explore novel** approaches unique to Apple Silicon
- ✓ **Question assumptions** about what's fast/slow

**For every operation we implement**:
1. Implement traditional/naive version (baseline)
2. Implement NEON-native version (designed for SIMD, not ported)
3. Implement Metal-native version (leverage unified memory, tile memory)
4. Explore heterogeneous version (P-cores + E-cores + GCD)
5. Explore novel approaches (Neural Engine, AMX, hardware compression)
6. **Measure everything, document what works AND what doesn't**

**Apple Silicon unique capabilities** (did not exist pre-2020):
- Unified memory (zero-copy CPU↔GPU)
- NEON as first-class citizen (not afterthought)
- Neural Engine (ML inference)
- Heterogeneous cores (P-cores + E-cores)
- AMX matrix engine
- Hardware compression
- Metal with tile memory
- GCD + QoS system integration

**See CLAUDE.md "Critical Philosophy" section for detailed guidance.**

## 🎉 Phase 1 Day 1 Accomplishments (October 30, 2025)

### Multi-Scale Pilot Experiments Complete ✅

**What we did**:
1. Generated 6 dataset scales (100 → 10M sequences, 3.3 GB total)
2. Implemented base counting operation with 3 backends (naive, NEON, parallel)
3. Built multi-scale benchmarking framework (`pilot_scales.rs`)
4. Ran 24 systematic experiments (6 scales × 4 configurations)
5. **Discovered critical bug**: Parallel using naive per-thread instead of NEON
6. Fixed bug: Changed parallel to use NEON per-thread
7. Re-ran experiments: Performance improved from 3.8× to 60× at scale
8. Documented findings in two comprehensive reports

**Key Findings**:
- NEON: 16-65× speedup (scale-dependent, universal benefit)
- Parallel threshold: 1,000 sequences minimum
- Combined optimization: 40-60× speedup at large scale
- Memory bandwidth: NOT the bottleneck (cache-bound instead)
- Composition rule: Parallel MUST use NEON per-thread

**Deliverables**:
- `datasets/` - 6 scales of test data (3.3 GB)
- `crates/asbb-ops/src/base_counting.rs` - Complete operation with all backends
- `crates/asbb-cli/src/pilot_scales.rs` - Multi-scale benchmarking harness
- `results/pilot_multiscale_findings.md` - 389 lines of analysis
- `results/combined_optimization_findings.md` - 381 lines documenting bug fix
- `results/combined_optimization_test.txt` - Raw experiment output

**Scientific Value**: This represents EXACTLY the systematic exploration ASBB was designed for. We:
1. Systematically tested across 5 orders of magnitude
2. Discovered performance cliffs and thresholds
3. Found a critical implementation bug through composition testing
4. Derived formal optimization rules backed by data

## What's Next: Phase 1 Continuation

### Current Status

✅ **Week 1 Day 1 COMPLETE**:
- Core types implemented
- Data generation tool complete
- Benchmarking harness operational
- First operation (base counting) fully implemented
- Multi-scale pilot complete (6 scales, 24 experiments)
- Critical optimization bug discovered and fixed
- Two comprehensive findings documents

### Immediate Next Steps (Week 1 Day 2-5)

**Goal**: Expand operation coverage and validate patterns

#### Option A: Implement More Operations (Recommended)

**Goal**: Test if patterns from base counting generalize to other element-wise operations.

**Priority operations** (similar profile to base counting):
1. **GC content**: Element-wise, similar to base counting
   - Expected: Similar NEON speedup (16-20×)
   - Expected: Similar parallel threshold (1K sequences)

2. **Reverse complement**: Element-wise, more complex NEON
   - Expected: Higher NEON speedup (BioMetal showed 98×)
   - Can borrow NEON implementation from BioMetal

3. **Quality score aggregation**: Element-wise (FASTQ only)
   - Expected: NEON benefit for vectorized min/max/mean
   - Tests different data pattern (quality scores vs bases)

**Deliverable**: 2-3 additional operations, multi-scale testing for each

**Value**: Validates if base counting patterns generalize to element-wise category

#### Option B: Test Different Operation Categories

**Goal**: Explore operations with different characteristics.

**Priority operations** (different profiles):
1. **Quality filtering**: Filtering category, branch-heavy
   - Expected: Lower NEON benefit (branching reduces vectorization)
   - Expected: Different threshold patterns

2. **K-mer extraction**: Search category, memory-intensive
   - Expected: Different bottlenecks (memory vs compute)
   - Expected: Different optimal configurations

**Deliverable**: 1-2 operations from different categories, multi-scale testing

**Value**: Tests if optimization patterns differ by operation category

#### Option C: 2-Bit Encoding Implementation 🚨 **CRITICAL CHECKPOINT**

**Goal**: Implement 2-bit DNA encoding and test impact.

**🚨 IMPORTANT**: Reverse complement shows **1× NEON speedup on ASCII** but BioMetal achieved **98× on 2-bit encoding**. This is a dramatic difference that must be explored!

**Why this matters**:
- 4× data density (64 bases per NEON register vs 16)
- Trivial complement operation (bit manipulation vs conditionals)
- Expected: **50-98× speedup for reverse complement** with 2-bit

**Tasks**:
1. Integrate 2-bit encoding from BioMetal (`biometal-core/BitSeq`)
2. Add 2-bit backend to all element-wise operations
3. Run multi-scale experiments with 2-bit encoding
4. Compare ASCII vs 2-bit for each operation

**Key questions**:
- Does 2-bit help cache-bound ops (base counting, GC content)?
- Does 2-bit dramatically help transform ops (reverse complement)?
- Is encoding operation-dependent?

**Expected results**:
- Base counting: 16× (ASCII) → ~20× (2-bit, modest improvement)
- GC content: 14× (ASCII) → ~18× (2-bit, modest improvement)
- Reverse complement: **1× (ASCII) → 98× (2-bit, dramatic improvement!)** 🚀

**Deliverable**: 2-bit encoding integrated, comparative analysis across encodings

**Value**: Unlocks 98× reverse complement speedup, tests encoding dimension

**Status**: DEFERRED to Phase 2 (after N=5 ASCII operations complete)

**See**: `results/revcomp_findings_2bit_checkpoint.md` for complete analysis

#### Option D: Real Data Validation

**Goal**: Validate synthetic findings on real sequencing data.

**Tasks**:
1. Download representative datasets (E. coli, human, meta)
2. Run base counting experiments on real data
3. Compare performance to synthetic data results
4. Identify any discrepancies

**Deliverable**: Real data validation report

**Value**: Ensures synthetic data findings transfer to production use cases

### Week 2-3: Expand Operations

**Goal**: Implement 10-20 primitive operations

**Priority operations**:
1. Base counting (DONE in week 1)
2. GC content
3. Reverse complement
4. Quality filtering
5. Length filtering
6. K-mer extraction
7. Hamming distance
8. Edit distance
9. MinHash sketching
10. FASTQ parsing

**For each operation**:
- Naive implementation
- NEON implementation (where applicable)
- Rayon parallel implementation
- Validation tests

**Borrow from BioMetal**:
- NEON reverse complement (98× validated)
- NEON base counting (85× validated)
- K-mer toolkit
- Quality filtering

---

### Week 4: Experimental Design

**Goal**: Finalize Level 1 experimental protocol

#### Create Experiment Protocol

**File**: `experiments/001-primitives/protocol.md`

```markdown
# Experiment 001: Primitive Operations

## Goal
Identify which hardware features work for which operation categories.

## Design
- Operations: 10 primitives (implemented in weeks 2-3)
- Hardware configs: 25 key configurations
- Data: Medium scale (10K sequences, 150bp)
- Total tests: 10 × 25 = 250

## Hardware Configurations
1. Baseline: Scalar, 1 thread, ASCII
2-5. NEON variants: NEON + 1/2/4/8 threads
6-9. Rayon variants: Scalar + 1/2/4/8 threads
10-13. NEON + Rayon: Combined + 1/2/4/8 threads
...
```

#### Generate Configuration Matrix

**File**: `experiments/001-primitives/design.toml`

```toml
[[config]]
name = "baseline"
use_neon = false
num_threads = 1
encoding = "ASCII"

[[config]]
name = "neon_1thread"
use_neon = true
num_threads = 1
encoding = "ASCII"

# ... 25 total configs
```

## When to Resume from New Context

### Before Starting New Session

**Read these files in order**:
1. `CLAUDE.md` - Strategic context and development guide
2. `NEXT_STEPS.md` - This file (current status)
3. `METHODOLOGY.md` - Experimental design details
4. `README.md` - Project overview

### Context to Provide

**Key facts**:
- This is a separate project from BioMetal
- Purpose: Systematic exploration of sequence/hardware space
- Goal: Derive formal optimization rules
- Timeline: 6 months to complete framework
- Current status: Setup complete, ready for Phase 1 implementation

**Strategic background**:
- Emerged from BioMetal technical debt realization
- 10 months of ad-hoc optimization → Need for systematic approach
- "Can we systematize this?" → YES → ASBB
- This is science (foundational research), not engineering (one-off solutions)

### Important Distinctions

**ASBB vs BioMetal**:
- ASBB: Framework for optimization research
- BioMetal: Practical bioinformatics toolkit
- Relationship: BioMetal will consume ASBB rules (via `asbb-rules` crate)
- Both valuable, different audiences, separate repos

---

## Development Guidelines

### Principles

1. **Scientific rigor over speed**
   - Proper experimental design (factorial, not brute force)
   - Statistical validation (confidence intervals, cross-validation)
   - Reproducible (version protocols, seed RNG, publish data)

2. **Start simple, expand systematically**
   - Week 1: 1 operation, end-to-end workflow
   - Weeks 2-3: 10 operations
   - Week 4: Full experimental design
   - Don't try to build everything at once

3. **Borrow from BioMetal where possible**
   - NEON implementations (reverse complement, base counting)
   - K-mer toolkit
   - 2-bit encoding
   - Don't reinvent the wheel

4. **Document as you go**
   - Update experiment protocols
   - Record unexpected findings
   - Note failed approaches (valuable!)

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't**: Try to implement all 20 operations before testing
✅ **Do**: Implement 1 operation, test end-to-end, then expand

❌ **Don't**: Optimize operations before measuring
✅ **Do**: Implement naive versions, let experiments guide optimization

❌ **Don't**: Run all possible tests
✅ **Do**: Use factorial design, hierarchical approach

❌ **Don't**: Only report successes
✅ **Do**: Document failures (GPU 25,000× slower is valuable knowledge!)

## Questions for Next Session

When resuming development, consider:

1. **Should we implement operations sequentially or in parallel?**
   - Sequential: Easier, validates workflow
   - Parallel: Faster, but riskier

2. **Which operations should we prioritize?**
   - Simple first (base counting, GC content)
   - Or diverse set (one from each category)

3. **How much should we borrow from BioMetal?**
   - NEON implementations: Yes, definitely
   - 2-bit encoding: Yes
   - K-mer toolkit: Yes
   - Everything else: Reimplement cleanly

4. **When should we run first real experiment?**
   - After 1 operation: Validates workflow
   - After 10 operations: More interesting results
   - Recommendation: After 3-5 operations (balance)
