# Next Steps for ASBB Development

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Status**: Framework setup complete, ready for Phase 1 implementation

---

## 🚨 Critical Development Philosophy 🚨

### Think Apple Silicon First, Not x86 First

**Key lesson from BioMetal**: We repeatedly fell back into traditional x86-era optimization patterns. This was limiting.

**For ASBB implementation**:
- ✓ **Learn from** bioinformatics literature (algorithms, domain knowledge)
- ✗ **Don't blindly copy** optimization strategies from x86 tools
- ✓ **Explore novel** approaches unique to Apple Silicon
- ✓ **Question assumptions** about what's fast/slow

**For every operation we implement**:
1. Implement traditional/naive version (baseline)
2. Implement NEON-native version (designed for SIMD, not ported)
3. Implement Metal-native version (leverage unified memory, tile memory)
4. Explore heterogeneous version (P-cores + E-cores + GCD)
5. Explore novel approaches (Neural Engine, AMX, hardware compression)
6. **Measure everything, document what works AND what doesn't**

**Apple Silicon unique capabilities** (did not exist pre-2020):
- Unified memory (zero-copy CPU↔GPU)
- NEON as first-class citizen (not afterthought)
- Neural Engine (ML inference)
- Heterogeneous cores (P-cores + E-cores)
- AMX matrix engine
- Hardware compression
- Metal with tile memory
- GCD + QoS system integration

**See CLAUDE.md "Critical Philosophy" section for detailed guidance.**

## What's Next: Phase 1 Implementation

### Immediate Priorities (Week 1)

**Goal**: Core infrastructure for experiments

#### Day 1: Core Types (asbb-core)

Implement fundamental types:

```rust
// crates/asbb-core/src/lib.rs

pub struct DataCharacteristics {
    pub format: DataFormat,
    pub num_sequences: usize,
    pub seq_length_mean: usize,
    pub seq_length_std: usize,
    pub read_type: ReadType,
    pub quality_distribution: Option<QualityDist>,
}

pub struct HardwareConfig {
    pub use_neon: bool,
    pub num_threads: usize,
    pub thread_assignment: ThreadAssignment,
    pub encoding: Encoding,
    pub use_unified_memory: bool,
    pub use_gpu: bool,
    // ... more fields
}

pub struct PerformanceResult {
    pub throughput_seqs_per_sec: f64,
    pub throughput_mbps: f64,
    pub latency_p50: Duration,
    pub memory_peak: usize,
    pub cpu_utilization: f64,
    pub output_matches_reference: bool,
    // ... more fields
}

pub trait PrimitiveOperation {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn category(&self) -> OperationCategory;
    fn execute_naive(&self, data: &[SequenceRecord]) -> Result<Output>;
    fn execute_neon(&self, data: &[SequenceRecord]) -> Result<Output>;
    // ... more backends
}
```

**Deliverable**: `asbb-core` crate with all core types

#### Day 2: Data Generation (asbb-datagen)

Implement synthetic dataset generation:

```rust
// crates/asbb-datagen/src/lib.rs

pub fn generate_dataset(chars: &DataCharacteristics) -> Vec<SequenceRecord> {
    // Reproducible (seeded RNG)
    // FASTA/FASTQ support
    // Realistic quality distributions
}

pub fn generate_fasta_sequence(...) -> BitSeq { /* ... */ }
pub fn generate_fastq_sequence(...) -> BitSeq { /* ... */ }
pub fn generate_quality_scores(...) -> Vec<u8> { /* ... */ }
```

**Deliverable**: Generate test datasets for all scales (100, 1K, 10K, 100K, 1M)

#### Day 3: First Operation (asbb-ops)

Implement first primitive operation (start simple):

```rust
// crates/asbb-ops/src/base_count.rs

pub struct BaseCountOp;

impl PrimitiveOperation for BaseCountOp {
    fn name(&self) -> &str { "base_count" }
    fn category(&self) -> OperationCategory { OperationCategory::ElementWise }

    fn execute_naive(&self, data: &[SequenceRecord]) -> Result<Output> {
        // Simple scalar implementation
    }

    fn execute_neon(&self, data: &[SequenceRecord]) -> Result<Output> {
        // NEON SIMD implementation (borrow from biometal-core)
    }
}
```

**Deliverable**: One fully-implemented operation with multiple backends

#### Day 4: Benchmarking Harness (asbb-explorer)

Implement experiment execution:

```rust
// crates/asbb-explorer/src/lib.rs

pub struct SequenceHardwareExplorer {
    operations: Vec<Box<dyn PrimitiveOperation>>,
    hardware_profile: HardwareProfile,
    experimental_design: ExperimentalDesign,
}

impl SequenceHardwareExplorer {
    pub fn run_experiment(
        &self,
        operation: &dyn PrimitiveOperation,
        data: &DataCharacteristics,
        config: &HardwareConfig,
    ) -> Result<PerformanceResult> {
        // 1. Generate dataset
        // 2. Warm-up (5 iterations)
        // 3. Measure (20 iterations)
        // 4. Validate correctness
        // 5. Statistical analysis
    }
}
```

**Deliverable**: Can run single experiment end-to-end

#### Day 5: Result Storage & First Test

Implement result storage and run pilot experiment:

```rust
// Use Polars for Parquet storage
pub fn save_results(results: &[PerformanceResult], path: &Path) -> Result<()> {
    // Convert to DataFrame
    // Save as Parquet
}
```

**Deliverable**: Run 10 pilot experiments, store results, validate workflow

### Week 2-3: Expand Operations

**Goal**: Implement 10-20 primitive operations

**Priority operations**:
1. Base counting (DONE in week 1)
2. GC content
3. Reverse complement
4. Quality filtering
5. Length filtering
6. K-mer extraction
7. Hamming distance
8. Edit distance
9. MinHash sketching
10. FASTQ parsing

**For each operation**:
- Naive implementation
- NEON implementation (where applicable)
- Rayon parallel implementation
- Validation tests

**Borrow from BioMetal**:
- NEON reverse complement (98× validated)
- NEON base counting (85× validated)
- K-mer toolkit
- Quality filtering

---

### Week 4: Experimental Design

**Goal**: Finalize Level 1 experimental protocol

#### Create Experiment Protocol

**File**: `experiments/001-primitives/protocol.md`

```markdown
# Experiment 001: Primitive Operations

## Goal
Identify which hardware features work for which operation categories.

## Design
- Operations: 10 primitives (implemented in weeks 2-3)
- Hardware configs: 25 key configurations
- Data: Medium scale (10K sequences, 150bp)
- Total tests: 10 × 25 = 250

## Hardware Configurations
1. Baseline: Scalar, 1 thread, ASCII
2-5. NEON variants: NEON + 1/2/4/8 threads
6-9. Rayon variants: Scalar + 1/2/4/8 threads
10-13. NEON + Rayon: Combined + 1/2/4/8 threads
...
```

#### Generate Configuration Matrix

**File**: `experiments/001-primitives/design.toml`

```toml
[[config]]
name = "baseline"
use_neon = false
num_threads = 1
encoding = "ASCII"

[[config]]
name = "neon_1thread"
use_neon = true
num_threads = 1
encoding = "ASCII"

# ... 25 total configs
```

## When to Resume from New Context

### Before Starting New Session

**Read these files in order**:
1. `CLAUDE.md` - Strategic context and development guide
2. `NEXT_STEPS.md` - This file (current status)
3. `METHODOLOGY.md` - Experimental design details
4. `README.md` - Project overview

### Context to Provide

**Key facts**:
- This is a separate project from BioMetal
- Purpose: Systematic exploration of sequence/hardware space
- Goal: Derive formal optimization rules
- Timeline: 6 months to complete framework
- Current status: Setup complete, ready for Phase 1 implementation

**Strategic background**:
- Emerged from BioMetal technical debt realization
- 10 months of ad-hoc optimization → Need for systematic approach
- "Can we systematize this?" → YES → ASBB
- This is science (foundational research), not engineering (one-off solutions)

### Important Distinctions

**ASBB vs BioMetal**:
- ASBB: Framework for optimization research
- BioMetal: Practical bioinformatics toolkit
- Relationship: BioMetal will consume ASBB rules (via `asbb-rules` crate)
- Both valuable, different audiences, separate repos

---

## Development Guidelines

### Principles

1. **Scientific rigor over speed**
   - Proper experimental design (factorial, not brute force)
   - Statistical validation (confidence intervals, cross-validation)
   - Reproducible (version protocols, seed RNG, publish data)

2. **Start simple, expand systematically**
   - Week 1: 1 operation, end-to-end workflow
   - Weeks 2-3: 10 operations
   - Week 4: Full experimental design
   - Don't try to build everything at once

3. **Borrow from BioMetal where possible**
   - NEON implementations (reverse complement, base counting)
   - K-mer toolkit
   - 2-bit encoding
   - Don't reinvent the wheel

4. **Document as you go**
   - Update experiment protocols
   - Record unexpected findings
   - Note failed approaches (valuable!)

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't**: Try to implement all 20 operations before testing
✅ **Do**: Implement 1 operation, test end-to-end, then expand

❌ **Don't**: Optimize operations before measuring
✅ **Do**: Implement naive versions, let experiments guide optimization

❌ **Don't**: Run all possible tests
✅ **Do**: Use factorial design, hierarchical approach

❌ **Don't**: Only report successes
✅ **Do**: Document failures (GPU 25,000× slower is valuable knowledge!)

## Questions for Next Session

When resuming development, consider:

1. **Should we implement operations sequentially or in parallel?**
   - Sequential: Easier, validates workflow
   - Parallel: Faster, but riskier

2. **Which operations should we prioritize?**
   - Simple first (base counting, GC content)
   - Or diverse set (one from each category)

3. **How much should we borrow from BioMetal?**
   - NEON implementations: Yes, definitely
   - 2-bit encoding: Yes
   - K-mer toolkit: Yes
   - Everything else: Reimplement cleanly

4. **When should we run first real experiment?**
   - After 1 operation: Validates workflow
   - After 10 operations: More interesting results
   - Recommendation: After 3-5 operations (balance)
