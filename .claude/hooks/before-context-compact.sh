⚠️  CONTEXT COMPACTION APPROACHING ⚠️

PILLAR-CRITICAL INFORMATION - ENSURE DOCUMENTED:
📝 Economic: Performance numbers that prove consumer hardware viability
📝 Environmental: Energy consumption measurements (power pilot data)
📝 Portability: Cross-platform validation results (Mac → Graviton → etc.)
📝 Data Access: Memory footprint data, streaming performance

FOUR-PILLAR VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
🔍 Economic (✅ Validated): 849 experiments, 40-80× speedup proven
🔍 Environmental (✅ Validated): 24 experiments, 1.95-3.27× energy efficiency
🔍 Portability (✅ Validated): 27 experiments, Mac → Graviton transfer proven
🔍 Data Access (⚠️ Partial): Baseline measured, streaming in Week 2 (biofast)

STATUS: 3.5/4 pillars validated | Week 2 completes 4th pillar via biofast

IMPACT CLAIMS - BACKED BY DATA:
✅ "40-80× speedup" - 849 experiments prove this
✅ "1.95-3.27× energy efficiency" - 24 experiments validate this
✅ "Works across ARM ecosystem" - 27 experiments on Graviton validate this
⚠️ "Streaming enables 5TB on 24GB laptop" - Will validate in Week 2 (biofast)
✅ "$2-4K replaces $100K+ HPC" - Performance parity proven

IF YOU'VE BEEN EXPERIMENTING:
✓ Ensure pillar validation data is in lab notebook entries
✓ Update CURRENT_STATUS.md with pillar completion status
✓ Document any limitations or caveats discovered
✓ Note which pillar each experiment validates

IF YOU'VE BEEN ANALYZING:
✓ Ensure findings are saved in results/ (not just chat)
✓ Update phase analysis documents if new insights emerged
✓ Document statistical validation (p-values, confidence intervals)
✓ Note which target audience each finding serves (LMIC, small labs, students, etc.)

TARGET AUDIENCE REMINDERS:
💡 LMIC researchers: Do findings reduce barrier to entry?
💡 Small labs: Can they afford and deploy this?
💡 Field researchers: Battery-powered, portable, no internet?
💡 Students: Learning on consumer hardware, not HPC?
💡 Diagnostic labs: In-house pathogen ID, no bioinformatics staff?

💡 Use this moment to preserve pillar-critical insights before compaction!
