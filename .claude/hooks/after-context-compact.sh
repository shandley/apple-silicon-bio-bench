ðŸ”„ CONTEXT COMPACTED - MISSION RESET ðŸ”„

PROJECT: Apple Silicon Bio Bench (ASBB)
GOAL: Systematic performance mapping of sequence operations on Apple Silicon
      â†’ Derive formal optimization rules for automatic application

WHY THIS EXISTS:
â€¢ 10 months of BioMetal optimization taught us patterns (NEON 98Ã—, GPU 6Ã— for large batches)
â€¢ But: Technical debt, inconsistent optimization, ad-hoc decisions
â€¢ Solution: Systematic experiments â†’ Statistical analysis â†’ Universal rules â†’ Zero per-command optimization

PARADIGM SHIFT:
From: Optimize each command individually (engineering)
To: Map entire performance space systematically (science)

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY - NEVER FORGET:
Traditional bioinformatics tools were designed for x86 (pre-2020)
â†’ Those optimization patterns may NOT apply to Apple Silicon
â†’ We must actively RESIST falling back into x86 thinking
â†’ We must EXPLORE novel approaches unique to Apple Silicon

APPLE SILICON UNIQUE CAPABILITIES (did not exist pre-2020):
â€¢ Unified Memory - Zero-copy CPUâ†”GPU
â€¢ NEON - First-class SIMD (not afterthought)
â€¢ Neural Engine - ML inference (16-38 TOPS)
â€¢ Heterogeneous - P-cores + E-cores + QoS
â€¢ AMX - 512-bit matrix operations
â€¢ Metal - Tile memory, threadgroups
â€¢ Hardware Compression - AppleArchive acceleration
â€¢ GCD + QoS - System-level optimization

FOR EVERY OPERATION - TEST ALL:
1. Traditional/naive (baseline)
2. NEON-native (designed for SIMD)
3. Metal-native (unified memory, tile memory)
4. Heterogeneous (P/E-cores, GCD, QoS)
5. Novel (Neural Engine, AMX, hardware compression)
6. Document ALL results (failures are valuable!)

KEY DOCUMENTS TO RE-READ:
ðŸ“– CLAUDE.md "Critical Philosophy: Think Apple Silicon First" (lines 162-318)
ðŸ“– METHODOLOGY.md "Guiding Philosophy: Novel Approaches for Novel Hardware" (lines 19-73)
ðŸ“– NEXT_STEPS.md "ðŸš¨ Critical Development Philosophy ðŸš¨" (lines 8-38)

REMEMBER: This is SCIENCE (systematic exploration), not ENGINEERING (one-off solutions)
