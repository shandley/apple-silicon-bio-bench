🔄 CONTEXT COMPACTED - MISSION RESET 🔄

PROJECT: Apple Silicon Bio Bench (ASBB) + biofast
MISSION: Democratizing Bioinformatics Compute

BREAKING DOWN FOUR BARRIERS:
1. 💰 Economic: Consumer hardware ($2-4K) replaces $100K+ HPC
2. 🌱 Environmental: 1.95-3.27× more energy efficient
3. 🔄 Portability: ARM NEON works across Mac, Graviton, RPi
4. 📊 Data Access: Streaming enables 5TB analysis on 24GB laptop

CURRENT PHASE (Nov 3, 2025): Foundation → Implementation
• Week 1 (Nov 4-8): Complete DAG traversal (740 experiments)
• Week 2 (Nov 11-14): Build biofast production library
• Week 3 (Nov 18-22): Validation + paper draft

PILLAR STATUS: 3.5/4 validated
✅ Economic: 849 experiments, 40-80× NEON speedup
✅ Environmental: 24 experiments, 1.95-3.27× energy efficiency
✅ Portability: 27 experiments, Mac → Graviton transfer
⚠️ Data Access: Baseline measured, streaming in Week 2

🚨 CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY:

1. DEMOCRATIZATION (not benchmarking)
   → Target: LMIC researchers, small labs, students, field researchers
   → Impact: Breaking down barriers to genomics access
   → NOT: "Apple Silicon is faster" BUT: "Everyone can do genomics now"

2. VALIDATE CLAIMS EXPERIMENTALLY (not calculations)
   → Good: "40-80× speedup proven by 849 experiments"
   → Bad: "240,000× memory reduction (calculated but not measured)"
   → Week 2 biofast will validate streaming experimentally

3. ARM ECOSYSTEM (not Apple exclusivity)
   → ARM NEON: Standard instruction set (not Apple-specific)
   → Validated: Mac M4 → AWS Graviton 3 transfer
   → Future: Raspberry Pi, Ampere, Azure Cobalt
   → Portable democratization, no vendor lock-in

4. PRODUCTION TOOL (not research prototype)
   → biofast: Auto-optimization, streaming, error handling, CLI
   → Based on 1,640 experiments (978 + 740 DAG completion)
   → Researchers can `cargo add biofast` and use immediately
   → Complete story: Measurement → Rules → Implementation
